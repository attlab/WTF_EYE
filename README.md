# WTF_EYE (AKA SCAM)

## Project Goals: 

In our previous WTF study we demonstrated that Process 2 emerges when participants are required to remember a spatial location in the absence of continuous sensory input (closed eyes).
In the current study we test whether Process 2 emerges for remembered spatial locations when sensory input is disrupted (by eye movements in the retention period) rather than cut off.
If true, then this would suggest that Process 2 is not just specific to eye closure.

In additon to eye movement, we also manipulate whether the task is to remember location (spatial) or color (non-spatial).
